This App displays a history of UK weather trends from a Meteorological Weather Station.

## Getting Started

The weather data is displayed using 3rd party library 'iOS Charts' (github.com/danielgindi/Charts)

### Running

1. Build the sample in the normal way (Product > Build).

2. In case you encountered 'Charts' framework error:
3. Go to the target's settings
4. Hit the "+" under the "Embedded Binaries" section
5. Select the Charts.framework

6. Run the sample (preferably on iPhone 8)

7. Once you run the sample you'll be prompted to select location from the UK map.

8. That will redirect you to the History Table View of weather data.

9. You can choose also Bar Chart and Line Chart from the tab bar

10. Different options are available in the 'Options' menu of the chart

11. You can zoom in or out chart data
